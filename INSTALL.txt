Simply activate the module. The tables you need will be installed.

Then, go to administer >> panels

Select 'add'.

Choose a layout; a simple one is best if you're just exploring.

Choose a URL for your new panel page. 'panel/test' is good if you're just exploring.

Add some content to each of the areas.

Click save, then click on the URL in the list to see what your new page looks like.
